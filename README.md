## Abstract
 I was asked to create an application that allows the user to play Rock, Paper and Scissors against the computer.
 It needed to have at least two difficulty levels where on the more difficult one will include 2 extra fighters.
 It had to then display the result and add and display who won to the board
 It had to store on the local storage the wins to be available after refreshing the page.
 My goal in this project it was to plan the whole execution of the project, by making a plan and schedule to achieve the goals on
 a timely manner.
 Another goal it was to write DRY and readable code, with no redundancy of functions or classes on the CSS, having a solid html structure from the beginning it was part of the plan also.


## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - VSCode
  - HTML
  - CSS
	


## Code Architecture
 The application it's formed by a player.js file where a player class it's being define, a game.js file where a class was created to handled 
 the game logic and board.
 The main.js file takes care of interacting with the DOM and the data model.

## Wins
	- I planned properly and was able to achieve my goals ahead of schedule without struggle.   
	- I was able to add small animations to the icons.
       

## Challenges + Improvements
	- It was challenging to find a proper way to store information and to find the balance between the use of my data model and the 
      local storage.
        
	- Future Iterations
        I could add a login section for the user to choose a name and an icon.
        I could add another difficulty level with more fighters.
